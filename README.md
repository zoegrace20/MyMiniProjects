# MyMiniProjects
This repository is filled with small projects that I've worked on for assignments or for fun. There is also code in here that was used as part of a bigger project. However, everything in this repository was coded by me. 
The senior capstone project is one that will take much effort to see on a different computer than my own. I have provided a screenshot of what those pages look like.
The other projects should be fairly easy to run. All of these projects were created using VSCode and they run perfectly on my computer.
